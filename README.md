# NBA-Stat-Tweeter

uses the nba_api @ https://github.com/swar/nba_api/tree/master/src/nba_api

This requires having access to the twitter api/developer account.

requirements.txt will you what libraries you will need for this project.

I use crontab to automate these scripts and email myself logs every day. If you choose to use crontab just make sure you use absolute file paths when you reference a file path.

in Config.py, you will need to enter in your twitter api credentials as well as email credentials and what NBA player you want to track.

Just thought this would be fun to share. Cheers
